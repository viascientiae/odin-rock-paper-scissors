# Rock Paper Scissors Project

## Project Overview

This is the "Rock Paper Scissors" project, a fundamental cornerstone in the JavaScript Basics unit of the Foundations Course offered by The Odin Project. This project represents my first steps into JavaScript programming, serving as a platform to apply and showcase the skills I've garnered thus far. In this project, I am tasked with creating a simple console-based Rock Paper Scissors game, setting the foundations for a more interactive version to be developed in a later lesson.

I am eager to dive deep into the nuances of JavaScript programming, building upon the theoretical knowledge gained in the previous lessons. While the primary goal is to develop a functional console-based game, I am also focused on writing clean, well-documented code, facilitating future expansions and adaptations of the project.

## Key Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, I will have honed my skills in the following areas:

- **JavaScript Fundamentals**: Gaining a deeper understanding and practical experience in the core concepts of JavaScript programming.
- **Function Implementation**: Learning to design and implement functions with specific roles, fostering modularity and reusability in code.
- **Console Interaction**: Mastering the use of browser console for testing and debugging JavaScript code.
- **Git & GitHub Usage**: Enhancing my proficiency in using Git and GitHub for version control, encouraging regular commits and proper documentation of changes.
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Sharpening my problem-solving skills through the logical structuring and implementation of game mechanics.

## Getting Started

To ensure a successful and structured approach to this project, I plan to undertake the following steps:

1. **Repository Setup**: Establish a GitHub repository to manage the project, committing my progress at regular intervals to chronicle both the developmental phases and my learning curve.
2. **Function Development**: Focus on the incremental development of functions, starting with the implementation of `getComputerChoice`, followed by the `playRound` function, and culminating in the creation of the `game` function to control the overall flow.
3. **Testing & Debugging**: Emphasize on iterative testing and debugging processes, utilizing the browser console to validate function outputs and game mechanics.
4. **User Interaction**: Implement user interaction through the `prompt` function, enhancing the gaming experience by allowing user inputs for gameplay decisions.
5. **Code Review & Optimization**: Engage in regular reviews of the codebase, optimizing the code structure and documentation to facilitate future expansions.

## Conclusion

The "Rock Paper Scissors" project serves as an exciting gateway into the world of JavaScript programming. As I venture forth, I aspire to not only fulfill the project objectives but also to showcase my burgeoning skills in web development.

I am excited to embark on this journey, fully embracing the learning process and the growth that accompanies the development of a fully functional project. The anticipation of evolving this console-based game into a graphical, interactive experience in future lessons fuels my motivation to excel in this initial phase.
